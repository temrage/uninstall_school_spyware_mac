## üìú Steps to Remove School Spyware

1. **Reset Your Entire Machine**  
   The most effective way to remove school's spyware is to reset your entire machine. Make sure to back up your important files before doing this!

2. **Do not bring your device to the IT for "registration"**  
   Do **not** bring your device to the school IT department. They will just reinstall the spyware you just removed. 

3. **Manually Install Your School's SSL Certificate**  
   To get connected to the school's internet, follow this [guide](https://github.com/temrage/school_ssl_inspection) to install the school's SSL certificate. This allows you to use the school internet without them spying on you **while not using their network** 

4. **Stop using Chrome with school's profile**  
   - Stop using **Chrome** with your school profile. Instead, use **Brave** or **Firefox**, and create a dedicated school profile for school.
   - The school's chrome profile forces the **Securly** extension to load and also sends all your browsing history to Google and the school. This step is very important! If you don't follow this step the school can still track you from the browser level.
