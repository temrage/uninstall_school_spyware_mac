## üìú Steps to Remove School Spyware

1. **Reset Your Entire Machine**  
   The most effective way to remove unwanted spyware is to start fresh by resetting your entire machine. Make sure to back up your important files before doing this!

2. **Avoid School IT Assistance**  
   Do **not** bring your device to the school IT department for help. They may reinstall the spyware you just removed. Take control of your device on your own terms.

3. **Manually Install Your School's SSL Certificate**  
   If you need to access school resources that require SSL inspection, follow this [guide](https://github.com/temrage/school_ssl_inspection) to install the school's SSL certificate. This allows you to use the school internet without spyware interference.

4. **Use an Alternative Browser and Profile**  
   - Stop using **Chrome** with your school profile. Instead, use **Brave** or **Firefox**, and create a dedicated school profile for browsing.
   - This helps avoid syncing directly with the school lockdown browser, which forces the **Securly** extension to load. This step is very important! If you don't follow this step the school can still track you from the browser level even outside of school.
